# NFG-VAE : Normalizing Flow based Graph Learning with Variational Autoencoder

- Project proposed for M1399_000400-2023fall(Deep Learning) at Seoul National University

## Topic

- Learning Non-Gaussian DAGs with IAF based VAE
- Learning Linear SEM with dependent noise (i.e. semi-Markovian graph) using IAF based VAE


## Environment

- Python 3.8
- Pytorch 2.1.0
